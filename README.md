# Office Space (e-commerce site)

1. This project uses a static data set (could be a DB or API in the future), and renders the content on a main page.
2. There is some conditional rendering on stock quantity on the main page(sold out and low stock).
3. state is managed though hooks, Links and localStorage ... just making things work for now.
4. Shopping Cart is currently using localStorage to maintain state. This should be changed to a DB in another iteration. This screen still needs some work to get items to render.

### **_ This project is on-going. _**

## Created with the following:

#### ReactJS / JS / JSX

Used; hooks, hardcoded data (a database could be used in the future), search/find algorithms to match like pairs(This allowed the correct item to be displayed on once selected), and passed state through localstorage and Link states to track add to cart selections.

#### HTML / CSS

straight forward, nothing fancy here. I did use the modern CSS reset.

#### Some BootStrap

Used a little BS to help with mobile first and some consistency with buttons and colors.
